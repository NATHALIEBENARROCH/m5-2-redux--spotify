# Stretch goal 2: Loading screen

Instead of showing the text "loadingâ€¦" while waiting for all the Spotify requests to resolve, let's do something more exciting and on-brand.

This spinner is from the NPM package `react-loader-spinner`. Look it up, and use its documentation to add it. You can also create a component, `FullScreenSpinner`, that uses this package and also manages the position (full-screen with a centered spinner, like in the GIF)
